# Code for Making Things Talk, 3rd edition

This directory contains code from the third edition of Making Things Talk, currently in progress. Examples here are all available under the [same terms as the original repository](https://github.com/tigoe/MakingThingsTalk2/blob/master/README). Code samples are separated by Chapter, except those examples that do not yet have a home in the book. I'll re-organize the repo once I'm done with the whole thing.
